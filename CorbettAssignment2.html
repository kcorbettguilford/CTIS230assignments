<h1>Guilford College Spring Semester Registration Guide</h1>
<p class="intro">Congratulations, its that time of year again—registration time! Below are tips and helpful hints on navigating class registration. Be sure to read and refer to this before your advising meeting.</p>  
<h2>Finding Classes</h2>  
<h3>Guilford College Website</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to guilford.edu > Current Students > Academic Departments and Majors >   Find Your Major related classes.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Bannerweb</h3>
<ol start="2">
<li>Go to Bannerweb > Login > Student > Student Records > Degree Evaluation > Spring 2024 > Program > Major > Generate your evaluation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Most likely you’ll be able to figure out what major related classes and Gen-Ed’s you still need. However, going over this with your advisor may be beneficial as well</p>
<h2>Searching on Bannerweb</h2>
<ol>
<li> Go to Bannerweb > Login > Student > Registration > Look-Up-Classes > Search by Spring 2024 Term > Submit.</li>
</ol>	
<p>Note: You should have received an advising worksheet. Use this worksheet to keep track of classes you need to take and are interested in. If not, use a Google Doc to keep track.</p>
 <h3>Searching Methods</h3>
 <ol start="2">
<li>General Search: Click any subject > Course Search.</li>  
</ol>
<p>Note: If you click on view sections of one class, Bannerweb won’t let you return to the previous screen and pick any other class. You will need to arrow back to selecting which term to search by.</p>
 <ol start="3">   
    <li>Advanced Search: Use the directions above the box that contains the subjects.</li>
</ol>   
 <h2>Remember</h2>   
 <ol>
  <li>Take note of which classes you need to take. </li>  
  <li>Keep the tabs open from the <strong>Finding Classes</strong> section. </li>
  <li>Copy and paste the CRNs, days, times, and names of each class you want to take to the advising worksheet.</li>
  <li>Ensure the classes you put in the first four slots dont have time conflicts. </li>
  <li>In the alternative classes section, ensure these classes run at the same time as a class you may need to replace.</li>
 </ol>
 <h2>Keep In Mind</h2>
<ol>
    <li>If you have any more questions for your advisor. Make sure to take note of these questions on the advising worksheet.</li>
    <li>Questions about internships, summer school, and study abroad, are great questions to ask during the meeting.</li>
</ol>
<p class="intro">You are all set for your spring advising meeting! Keep in mind you may not get first pick for classes; however, using the advising sheet will help you craft your schedule. Check with your advisor about the registration window and your banner pin.</p>
