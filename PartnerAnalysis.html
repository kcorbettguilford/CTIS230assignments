<h2>Audience Analysis</h2>
<h3>Our Audience</h3>
    <p class="intro">Our main audiences are the Guilford County Commissioners and the CPN. </p>
<h3>CPN: Interests, Needs, Motivations</h3>
<p>
    In terms of sustainability the CPN is interested in GSC schools to convert to 100 percent clean energy in 2050. The CPN needs to campaign and speak to local governments about making this change. The CPN is motivated because Superintendent Oakley did commit to the transition, however she didn’t set any sort of plan or timeline. The CPN wants to make sure their plan will be in full effect, because at the end of the day they are motivated by the outcomes of switching to 100 percent clean energy.</p>
<h3>County Commissioner: Interests, Needs, Motivations</h3>
<p> County Commissioners, most likely already understand the basis of what sustainability is and have heard terms like “going green” or “renewable energy.” They most likely will need to know exactly how and what that looks like. They’ll need to know things like how much certain things cost and how long things will take to be installed. Showing them what other successful counties did would motivate them to make their decision. They are in the position they are in for the “good” of the county, so I’m sure hearing how green schools and green buildings have impacted teachers and students will persuade them into making a decision./p>
<h3> Who would this all effect? </h3>
<p>Converting to 100% green energy will affect everybody. From what I’ve gathered there is no set timeline on how long it may take for a building to convert to clean energy. Old buildings require more retrofitting than newer buildings. It’s also easier to start out with 100% clean buildings and schools than it is to retrofit the schools with the equipment. Many schools from the 70’s and 50’s were built with materials that cause asbestos and respiratory issues among students.</p>
<p>Converting buildings or even building buildings all takes a lot of time especially if you want it done right. Retrofitting buildings with clean energy needs a plan because some buildings may not have the space for solar panels and other equipment. It’s easy to say “yes, let’s convert to clean energy,” but how are you going to do it?</p>
<h3>Why would the County Commissioners disagree?</h3>
<p>I think the County Commissioners may find the proposal troubling because of the way Margaret was talking about it. I think that “shaming” them isn’t a useful way to spend anybody's time. I’m sure Guilford County has a lot of pressing issues and people coming to the commissioners all the time. Also the County Commissioners do handle money and I’m sure they would like to know how much things cost and Margaret didn’t have an answer to how much it may cost or even an estimate.</p>
<h2>Partner Profile</h2>
<h3>CPN</h3>
<p> The CPN is a group of local environmentalists. Their goal is to campaign and ask for the local government to approve a deal of 100% clean energy. The CPN’s other goals are… The CPN is invested in clean energy for Guilford County because they understand what can come out of converting to clean energy. The CPN’s website notes “[a] reduction in emissions from dirty energy sources will result in tangible improvements in student health and performance, particularly among the most vulnerable. Greener schools can contribute directly to the educational and operational objectives of GCS.”</p>
<h3>Past and Current Communications Projects</h3>
<p>The CPN has already been involved with campaigns, specifically the plan about converting GSC schools to 100% clean energy. If the CPN can show the benefits of converting to 100% green schools it can help persuade the County Commissioners to convert other things to 100% green energy.</p>
<h3>CPN’s Need’s</h3>
<p>The CPN’s needs in regards to communications are probably reports of what other counties have done. This could create a consensus among counties, instead of saying blank counties did this and this happened. I also think that flyers with quick information about sustainability will be helpful and also maybe having a place where people can sign up online and show the commissioners that X amount of people have signed this plea and they want this to happen.</p>
